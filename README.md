Create and validate rules for your properties for all your app!

Improve the quality of your data using validation rules. Validation rules verify that the data the user enters into record meets the standards you specify before the user can save the record. A validation rule can contain a formula or expression that evaluates the data in one or more fields and returns a value "True" or "False". Validation rules also include an error message to display to the user when the rule returns a value "False" due to an invalid value.

#### ValidationsRules or MyOwnImplementation
I get this question a lot, so here it is from a recent issue opened up. This plugin helps you maintain and better test your code in a scalable way by showing the results directly in the UI. This ensures the fastest, most secure, and reliable creation and editing validation rules per application. Additionally, it works with **any Xamarin application**, not just Xamarin.Forms.

Even if you do all the implementation of validation rules it will take a little time. And if you have to do several validations, sometimes it can be really hard.

To me that isn't as reliable as having an abstraction that does all the work for me.

### Extension
* Available on Visual Studio Marketplace: [Validation Rule Template](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LuisMatos.ValidationRuleTemplate) [![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/vscode-marketplace/v/LuisMatos.ValidationRuleTemplate.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LuisMatos.ValidationRuleTemplate)
