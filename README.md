#### ValidationsRules or MyOwnImplementation
I get this question a lot, so here it is from a recent issue opened up. This plugin helps you maintain and better test your code in a scalable way by showing the results directly in the UI. This ensures the fastest, most secure, and reliable creation and editing validation rules per application. Additionally, it works with **any Xamarin application**, not just Xamarin.Forms.

Even if you do all the implementation of validation rules it will take a little time. And if you have to do several validations, sometimes it can be really hard.

To me that isn't as reliable as having an abstraction that does all the work for me.
